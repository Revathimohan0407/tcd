## My Favorite Programming Language

My favorite programming language is Terraform and Python because they are versatile, easy to learn, and widely used in all the cloud platforms and also for data science, machine learning, and web development.


Revathi's Change : I specialize in Azure and cloud infrastructure.

I know some basics of python but its still little hard to keep up when there are new terminologies.
